- React is a JS library to create reusable components
- uses JSX = JavaScript XML for html-like code
- lightweight version of the real DOM [updated real time, no need to refresh]

- npm create vite@latest

- you can do external styling [global/affects all components]
- you can create a dedicated style sheet for each component [.modules.<component-name>]
- you can do inline styling for components that need minimal styling

PROPS
- read only properties shared between components
- parent component can send data to a child component 

PROP TYPES
- mechanism that ensures that passed value is of correct datatype
- when an incorrect data type is entered, it will issue a warning in the console
example: age: PropTypes.number

DEFAULT PROPS
- default values for props in case they are not passed from the parent component
example: name: "Guest" 

CONDITIONAL RENDERING
- control what gets rendered in the application based on certain conditions [show, hid, or change components]
- you can use if-else, the ternary operator or store the elements in const then check for the conditions
